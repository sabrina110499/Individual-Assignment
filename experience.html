<h1 style="font-family: Colonna MT">Handling a business is aint easy things to do. In order to success in business, you need always know how to manage your own self. As for me, myself, i'm currently handling my parents business which is lempok durian. For me, handling food industry business is quite challenging as food is something that just nice to kept for 3 to 4 months. And for the Lempok Durian itself, the Durian we used need to be processed wisely so that it will not effect the taste when being mixed with sugar. Lempok Durian need to be kept in room temperature as Durian is sensitive with hot weather. The most challenging is that, some customers do not kept it carefully and blame us for the defect of the taste. Handling the chatty customers need you a high patience and way of you to persuade them. </h1>
